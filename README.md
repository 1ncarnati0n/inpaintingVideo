üìëRequirements
The Segment-Anything repository has been cloned and renamed as sam, and the aot-benchmark repository has been cloned and renamed as aot.

Please check the dependency requirements in SAM and DeAOT.

The implementation is tested under python 3.9, as well as pytorch 1.11.0+cu113 and torchvision 0.12.0+cu113 We recommend equivalent or higher pytorch version.

Use the install.sh to install the necessary libs for SAM-Track-Inpainting

```
bash script/install.sh
```
